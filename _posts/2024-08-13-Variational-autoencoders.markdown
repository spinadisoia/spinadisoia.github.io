# Variational Autoencoders: An Introduction

![VAE Scheme](images/VAE_scheme.png)

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a class of generative models that are used to learn latent representations of data. They are a type of autoencoder that introduces a probabilistic twist, in order to regularize the latent space and generate new data similar to input data.

VAEs use the encoding-decoding structure to extract the fundamental characteristics of data. The model do not simply learn a compressed representation of the input data, but encode data with a latent distribution from which the latent representation is sampled.

In this article we will introduce the autoencoder architecture and how the variational inference theory is exploit in the VAE model.

# Autoencoder Basics

Autoencoders are neural networks used to learn efficient representations of data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction or feature learning.

# Variational Inference

Unlike traditional autoencoders, VAEs introduce a probabilistic layer to the encoding process. This allows them to generate new samples by sampling from the learned latent space.

## Applications of VAEs

VAEs have a wide range of applications, including:

- Image generation
- Data denoising
- Anomaly detection

## Conclusion

Variational Autoencoders are a powerful tool in the machine learning toolkit, offering flexibility and capability for a range of tasks in generative modeling.
